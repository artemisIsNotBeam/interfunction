# Hi this is a guide to interact with ano
ther contract

1. create an interface
2. put your functions in that
note only can use a externnal functions here
4. you can only use if the contract u want statrs with 

note the basic of this is if something is inherting functions
from like erc20 or ownable

you can setup an interface with predetermined functions there remeber
you can only use the external functiosn. 

so Lets say someone makes an ERC20 token
if they make it with contract theirToken is ERC20{

}

then I can setup an interface with functions it inhereted form ERC20
example: balanceOf and transfer
